Marination is a series of notes which I will create while understanding a resource. So basically they are notes of notes/blogs/videos. They may contain my conversation with LLM which made me understand the topic.

This is the second marination on the topic of Project Thinking. This is from video workshop [Product Thinking Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyo50QGmH_s) by Shreyas Doshi.

### **Summary of the Video**

In the "Product Thinking Workshop" by Shreyas Doshi, the speaker delves into the fundamental differences between project thinking and product thinking. The workshop emphasizes the importance of shifting from a purely execution-focused mindset to one that prioritizes understanding user needs and creating impactful outcomes. Shreyas provides practical frameworks and templates to help professionals adopt product thinking in their work.

### **Core Concepts**

**Product Thinking**: A strategic approach centered on **why** and **what**. It's about deeply understanding user motivations, conceiving innovative solutions, and predicting the effects of those solutions. The goal is to optimize for impactful outcomes and effectiveness.

**Project Thinking**: A tactical approach focused on **when** and **who**. It's about efficiently executing plans, managing resources, and coordinating actions to meet pre-defined expectations. The goal is to optimize for outputs and efficiency

### **Key Concepts Explained**

| Process | Project Thinking | Product Thinking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Most Important Question** | **When**: "When will this feature be delivered?" | **Why**: "Why are we building this feature?" |
| **Optimize For** | **Output**: Completing tasks and delivering features. | **Outcome**: Achieving user satisfaction and business goals. |
| **Improves** | **Efficiency**: Doing things right. | **Effectiveness**: Doing the right things. |
| **Most Important Capability** | **Execution**: Ability to deliver projects on time and within budget. | **Insight**: Deep understanding of user needs and market trends. |
| **Biggest Differentiator** | **Discipline**: Adherence to plans and processes. | **Creativity**: Innovative solutions that set products apart. |
| **Biggest Secret** | **Influence**: Motivating the team to execute efficiently. | **Simulation**: Projecting how changes will impact users and outcomes. |
| **Effect On Outcome** | **Multiplicative**: Scales outputs linearly. | **Exponential**: Can lead to breakthrough results. |
| **Most Important Core Value** | **Action**: Prioritizing getting things done. | **Empowerment**: Enabling teams to make decisions based on user insights. |
| **When Done In Excess** | **Heroic Effort Lacking Results**: Burnout without significant impact. | **Great Plan Gathering Dust**: Over-planning without execution. |

### **Template for Product Thinking**

1. **Suspend the project thinking mindset**- Take your project thinking hat off. Put the product thinking hat on.
   - *Tip*: Before jumping into planning, take a moment to question existing assumptions. Encourage team members to think beyond deadlines and deliverables.
2. **Prioritize your goals**- Ask **why?** and **So what?** often. What **effects you want to create** on users?
   - *Ask yourself*: "Why does this matter to our users?" "What change do we want to see after implementing this?"
3. **Understand your users' needs**- Pay particular attention to **objectional and frictional points**. Look for **unexpressed needs**.
   - *Action*: Conduct user interviews or surveys to uncover pain points. Pay attention to feedback that users might not overtly express.
4. **Generate options**- Don't be afraid of **big ideas**. Embrace **creativity and differenciation**.
   - *Exercise*: Hold brainstorming sessions with diverse team members to foster creative ideas. No idea is too big or small at this stage.
5. **Simulate**- **Visualize** how each option will **play out**. Then **repeat** until you converge.
   - *Technique*: Create user journey maps or prototypes to visualize how users will interact with the new solution. Refine based on feedback.

### **Real-Life Implementation: Shifting from Project to Product Thinking**


**The Problem**: Many teams get stuck in project thinking, losing sight of the bigger picture. This leads to a mismatch between expectations and actual impact.

**The Solution**: An Iterative Approach:
  1. Start with Product Thinking: Brainstorm, understand user needs, and define the desired outcomes.
  2. Engage in Project Thinking: Plan the execution, allocate resources, and set timelines.
  3. Refine: Use the insights from project thinking to further refine the product thinking, and iterate.
  4. Take Decisive Action: Execute with a clear hypothesis of what needs to be done.

**How to Learn Product Thinking**:
  1. Suspend the Project Thinking Mindset: Consciously set aside the focus on timelines and resources.
  2. Prioritize Real Goals (WAYRTTD): Continuously ask, "What are you really trying to do?".
  3. Understand User Needs: Go beyond expressed needs to uncover unexpressed needs by understanding user objections.
  4. Generate Options: Don't be afraid of big, creative, and differentiating ideas.
  5. Simulate: Visualize how each option will play out and iterate until you find the best path.
