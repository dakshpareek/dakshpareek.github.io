I have my media server running on my home server where I host different types of media. A month back I get to know about [Hoarder](https://github.com/hoarder-app/hoarder) which is A self-hostable bookmark-everything app.

I hosted in on my server and uploaded all my bookmarks from different devices. It lacked the functionality of Sorting bookmarks by date.
So I thought to add to add it to my instance of Hoarder.

## How I got started

I forker the repo and learned about project structure and open source contribution guidelines.
I read [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) and [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/).

I looked into the codebase and found that it is actively maintained and has a lot of features.

## How I contributed

I tried understanding about the flow of code and then added my feature of sorting bookmarks by date [Newest First and Oldest First].

After I successfully tested the feature on my local machine, I pushed the code to my forked repo and created a pull request.

The PR was reviewed and I received few positive feedbacks by maintainers and they also said it was a needed feature.

After my changes are done, I again asked for a review and this time everything was in order and contributors were happy to merge my PR.

Today that feature got released and published on various platforms.

I saw my name in the list of contributors and I was happy to see that my first contribution was successful.

## Conclusion

It was a great experience to contribute to an open source project. I learned a lot about the project and how to contribute to it.

If you are looking for your first contribution, I would recommend you to start with a small feature and then work on it.
