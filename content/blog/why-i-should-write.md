title: "Why I write in era of LLM"

This is my first online writing which I will be documenting beneath my personal space. I write in bullet points and in a very concise way. In the current stage of my life, I don't like writing because LLMs can do it for us. Then why bother to write when you can just prompt anything, and it will be better than your draft?

But I know that it lacks depth, nuance, and anecdotes.

I am starting to write here because of the reasons below. This list of reasons are for me so I can look back to them again in future and see what I was thinking in that phase of life, and align if needed.

- I want to share my experience with life/tech/different domains here. It is an online documentation of my thought process. I don't want to impress others with the blogs but to merely share what I got to know in some process.

- I want to have a personal brand which supports my case in hiring. It should come out as I have domain knowledge and I am curious about stuff and I am good fit for a role.

- Networking is one more reason I am doing it. I connect with those people whose writing I resonate with most. So in hope of connecting with different people and building a life long connection with them, I am pursuing this writing.

- People say writing improves one's critical thinking and communication skills when they write. Hence I am starting this. I am thinking of first writing my draft without any LLM help to get the theme and writing style correct. At the end, I will be checking it through an LLM for improvement and also listing down in my blog so next time I avoid those pitfalls. I'll see if I can find more methods to improve my writing.

- Writing about what inspired me to start, the roadblocks I hit, and that time I nearly gave up (or a small win that kept me going) helps me see my own arc. Itâ€™s raw, real, and keeps me grounded.

- I will going to share what I have learned in my journey.

- I will try to zoom out and share bigger picture for the things I am writing about.

That's it for now.
