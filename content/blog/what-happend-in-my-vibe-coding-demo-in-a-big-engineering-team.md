Below is my thought dump after I had given a demo on vibe coding using Cursor to my team.
These are though dumps without edit. These are raw thoughts without any modification or explaination.

- Have call screen window on second display so it's easier to perform action like mute, camera off.
- Less theory and more practice. If a point is in theory and demo as well then tell about it when you are showing it instead of first going through theory and then demo.
- I tend to get dry throat after 15-20 mins so keep water handy but it didn't worked for me. I was constantly coughing even after taking a sip of water.
- Having you dialogue from second screen and reading those did not work while you are looking at two screens. Don't do that. Instead create script and go ones with it so you remember 50-60% of it.
- Things can go unexpected so take things lightly. And convey that lightness as well.
- If things are not in your comfort zone, it comes to your mind that let's give up. Someone else will do this. I don't need to do that and this is not my job. Or people will judge me and evaluate me. All these things will happen but my task is to get out of my comfort zone and try things.
- Ask for feedback. Genuinely.
- Take a closed look at time and don't let that session out of assigned time.
