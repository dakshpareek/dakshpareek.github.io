These are my notes from the [Netflix Cultural Deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/113qRKkqCLLSr7mh2L-TJEBKAuWhzxB1Q/view).

- It’s about effectiveness – not effort – even though effectiveness is harder to assess than effort.
- Great Workplace is **Stunning Colleagues**.
- High performance people will do better work if they understand the context.
– Mediocre colleagues or unchallenging work is what kills progress of a person’s skills.
- Individuals should manage their own career paths, and not rely on a corporation for planning their careers.

Two Necessary Condition for Promotion
- Job has to be big enough
- Person has to be a superstar in current role
  – Could get the next level job here if applying from outside and we knew their talents well
  – Could get the next level job at peer firm that knew their talents well


### Loyalty is Good
- Loyalty is good as a stabilizer
- If a company hits a temporary rough patch then, company want people to stick with them in this time.
- But unlimited loyalty to shrinking firm or to an ineffective employer is not good.

### The Rare Responsible Person
- Self motivating
- Self aware
- Self disciplined
- Self improving
- Acts like a leader
- Doesn’t wait to be told what to do
- Never feels “that’s not my job”
- Picks up the trash lying on the floor
- Behaves like an owner

## What it means to become a high-performance individual
To be a high performer, you must consistently demonstrate these:
- **Judgment**: This is about making smart decisions, even when things are unclear or ambiguous. It's not just about solving a problem, but understanding why the problem occurred (root causes) and thinking strategically about what needs to be done immediately versus what can be improved later.
- **Communication**: Practice active listening by rephrasing what you hear to confirm understanding. Structure your emails and presentations for clarity and conciseness. When disagreements arise, focus on the ideas and issues, not personal attacks, and ensure your tone remains calm and respectful.
- **Impact**: Focus on tangible outcomes. Regularly ask yourself, "What is the most important thing I can do right now to move the needle?" Prioritize tasks that deliver significant value, complete them efficiently, and consistently meet or exceed expectations. Don't be afraid to take initiative to get things done.
- **Curiosity**: A high-performance individual is eager to learn, not just within their specific role but broadly about the company's strategy, its market, its customers, and even its suppliers. It means being knowledgeable and willing to contribute effectively outside your direct area of expertise.
- **Innovation**: Don't just accept the status quo. Look for opportunities to streamline processes, find more efficient ways of working, or propose novel approaches to challenges. Be open to experimenting and learning from both successes and failures.
- **Courage**: If you see something that doesn't align with the company's stated values or best interests, address it constructively. Be willing to voice a dissenting opinion in a respectful manner, especially if you believe it leads to a better outcome. Take calculated risks that could lead to significant positive impact.
- **Passion**: High performers inspire others with their "thirst for excellence." They care deeply about the company's success, celebrate achievements, and are tenacious in pursuing goals.
- **Honesty**: Being known for directness and candor, avoiding political maneuvering, and being transparent. This includes only saying things to colleagues' faces that you would say behind their back, and being quick to admit your mistakes.
- **Selflessness**: Actively collaborate across teams. Share your knowledge and insights generously. Be open to others' ideas and perspectives, even if they differ from your own, and always consider the broader company impact of your decisions.

- Focus on Effectiveness, Not Just Effort: Focus purely on "effectiveness" – how much, how quickly, and how well you get important work done, especially under deadlines.
