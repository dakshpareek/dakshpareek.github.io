# Notes App

A minimal personal notes application built with React and TypeScript that allows you to write and save notes directly in your browser.

## Features

- **Simple and Clean Interface**: Focus on writing without distractions.
- **Automatic Saving**: Notes are automatically saved to your browser's local storage.
- **Word and Character Count**: Real-time display of word and character counts.
- **Clear Notes**: Easily clear your notes with a single click.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Why I Built This

I often needed a quick and straightforward way to jot down thoughts or copy snippets without switching applications. Existing solutions were either too feature-heavy or not readily accessible. This project provides a lightweight, no-frills note-taking app accessible directly from the browser.
