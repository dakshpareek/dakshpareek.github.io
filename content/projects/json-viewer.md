# JSON Viewer

A modern web application that helps developers visualize, format, and validate JSON data with ease.

## Features

- Real-time JSON formatting and validation
- Syntax highlighting with Ace Editor
- Auto-formatting on paste
- Error detection and reporting
- Clean and modern UI

## Why I Built This

While working with APIs and JSON data daily, I found myself frequently switching between different JSON formatting tools. None of them had exactly the combination of features and user experience I wanted. This project was born out of the need for a fast, reliable, and user-friendly JSON formatting tool.

## Technical Implementation

- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Code Editor**: Ace Editor for syntax highlighting and editing capabilities
- **Formatting**: Prettier for consistent JSON formatting
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Error Handling**: Real-time JSON validation with detailed error messages
